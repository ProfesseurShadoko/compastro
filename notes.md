we choose G=1. from there it is important to set mass units, distance units, time units and so on. dpeending on what we put, we represent galaxy, star cluster, or something else.


if the total mass (this is what we want to define) is 10^10 M_sun and distance = 10 Kpc (this fixes time unit) we get a galaxy. Playing with systems of units is important,

at some point we will want to measure crossing time (computed in the lesson) (we want to measure also)

do densitiy profile (task 1) in log scale



tree code:

compute first the multipole, esay to debug with compare to actual potential profile. once multipole is okay (at first, second, other orders) start with trees.



tree code might be slower than direct summation, it is well possible, thus not evolving it is ok.
